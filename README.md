# Solar-Pump-IOT-Project
The HelioDrive project is a solar pump IoT system. It uses an ESP32 to read a VFD via Modbus RTU/RS485 and transmits data securely over MQTT/TLS to a web dashboard. Users can monitor real-time metrics (temp, water level, power) and control the pump's ON/OFF status and speed.
